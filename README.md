**Requirements / Caveats / Disclaimers**


Vibecoded - I mostly vibecoded this. I know people have their issues with vibe coding so feel free to avoid if you don't want to use it. No one is forcing you.


Backups - I have made it so that the install script creates a backup first, and the uninstall script restores it back. 


Distro - This was made for my system and built on/for CachyOS so not sure if it works for PopOS or Fedora etc. You may also need to tweak some color settings to match your system.


Github use - I have only posted 1 other thing on Github before, so not sure if I've uploaded it properly... hopefully someone confirms if they decide to test it.



Any feedback or suggested improvements are welcome (but don't complain about the vibe coding because I am already aware). I only ever create stuff for personal use and upload it on the odd chance it helps others; I'm not going to proactively check whether this works on every distro etc. but I am happy to help if you provide some comments/feedback.
