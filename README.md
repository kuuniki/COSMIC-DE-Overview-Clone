**Disclaimers**


Vibecoded - I mostly vibecoded this. I know people have their issues with vibe coding so feel free to avoid if you don't want to use it. No one is forcing you.


Backups - I have made it so that the install script creates a backup first, and the uninstall script restores it back. 


**Misc**

If you come across any bugs, have any feedback or suggested improvements then please do log this as an 'issue' and I'm more than happy to help. Any complaints of vibe coding will be ignored, but rewrite suggestions are also welcome. I care about results over method.
